;# Smart Drink Vending Machine

## üìå Project Overview
The **Smart Drink Vending Machine** is an innovative vending system designed to allow customers to purchase drinks both **physically at the vending machine** and **remotely via their smartphones or an external website**. The system integrates multiple payment methods, security features, and environmental monitoring to ensure optimal operation.

## üéØ Customer Requirements
### ‚úÖ Ordering & Payment
- Customers can purchase drinks **physically** using a **numeric keypad and LCD screen**.
- Remote orders can be placed via **a smartphone or website**.
- Payment options:
  - **RFID card reader**
  - **QR code or Barcode scanning** via a camera connected to the vending machine
  - **Other electronic payment methods** (future enhancements)

### ‚úÖ Collection System
- Drinks ordered remotely can be collected using a **QR code or Barcode**.
- The generated code is scanned by a **camera connected to the vending machine**.

### ‚úÖ Security & Anti-Theft Features
- **Burglar detection system** to detect if the vending machine door has been pried open.
- If unauthorized access is detected:
  - **Buzzer alarm** is triggered.
  - **Image is captured** and sent to the service team.

### ‚úÖ Environmental Monitoring
- The vending machine maintains **optimal conditions for drink storage**.

## User Guide
### 1. Database Setup
  - Open the system-wide environment file:
      *sudo nano/etc/environment*
  - Add this at the end of the file (without export):
      *DB_PATH="/home/pi/user's custom naming directory/src/sqlite-data/vending_machine.db"*
  - Save `(CTRL+X)`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.
  - Reboot for changes to take effect.
      *sudo reboot*
  - If you run echo $DB_PATH on terminal,
      */home/pi/user's custom naming directory/src/sqlite-data/vending_machine.db" will appear.*
  - Run initialize_database.py
  - Run insert_user.py
  - Run generate_data.py (optional if you want extra data)

### 2. Running Docker
  - *docker build -t vending-app-f Dockerfile-app .*
  - *docker run -d --name vending-app -p 5000:5000 \
    --env-file ../.env \
    -v /home/pi/alvin/DevOps/src/sqlite-data:/sqlite-data \
    -v /home/pi/alvin/DevOps/src/qrcodes:/app/qrcodes \
    kinda1vin/vending-app:latest*

### 3. Run admin.py for admin server
### 4. Run app.py for remote order system from website
  - Customer will be able to order drink from website and purchase by card and apple pay.
  - After payment is confirmed, QR code for drink collection will be sent to customer.
### 5. Run telegram_bot.py
### 6. Run main.py.
